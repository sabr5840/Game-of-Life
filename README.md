# Conway's Game of Life

Welcome to the Conway's Game of Life project! This implementation provides a visual simulation of cellular automaton based on the rules devised by mathematician John Conway.

## Introduction

The Game of Life is a zero-player game where the evolution is determined by the initial state of the cells. It follows specific rules, such as cells surviving, dying, or new ones being born based on their neighbors.

## Project Overview

The project is structured with a clear separation of concerns into model and view functions. The model is represented by a 2D array, allowing for easy customization of the grid size. The user interface provides controls to clear the grid, add random cells, and displays automatic updates of generations.
